This is my first project website. As it is already 3am, I will not make it a very long post. But I don't intend to write lengthy posts here anyway. Idea is to make a project daily and write something about it here.

Here are the things I did today:

- Made a list of resources for self study
- Decided on a schedule to follow
- Purchased a personal domain name
- Setup this Jekyll site from scratch

My earlier home page was a very simple one with just a list of projects. I have moved it to [here now](http://lalwanivikas.github.io/home-page-v1/). My new site will have separate sections for projects, about, contact and a blog.

There is close to zero CSS in this site now and I intend to revisit it later to make it beautiful :)
