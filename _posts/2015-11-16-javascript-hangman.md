title: JavaScript Hangman
day: 16
---

A very satisfying project today - hangman game! We used to play this a lot when I was a kid and coding it today felt great. I gave it a twist by allowing words only related to JavaScript instead of general vocabulary. 

If you are into JavaScript, you will [enjoy playing it](http://vikaslalwani.com/projects/hangman/). 

Key Points:
---
- Uses HTML5 Canvas to draw the hangman
- Not a huge pipeline of words as of now, you might see repetitions.
- Simple design. Mobile friendly.
- Was fun implementing the logic and writing code to avoid gotchas.
