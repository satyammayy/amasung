title: Snake Game (awesome version!)
day: 19
---

As promised yesterday, I have an awesome version of snake game today. Yesterday's version was crap, but today's app is great.

If you have few mins, do give it a [try here](http://vikaslalwani.com/projects/snake-game/).

Key Points:
---
- I spent a lot of time tinkering with the game logic but was not able to figure out an accurate solution today as well. I was on the right path when I gave up so that feels bad. Lesson learned - don't give up quickly. Try some more and you might solve the problem.
- I consulted few tutorials for help - some were good and others not so. Two that stood out are [this](https://yamiko.ninja/blog/Lets-Build-a-HTML5-Game-Snake) and [this](http://www.competa.com/blog/2015/05/how-to-build-a-snake-game-using-javascript-and-html5-canvas/).
- Slightly off-topic point, but one which I have noticed couple of times now. It's important to have pen and paper to write things down for better understanding when you are reading someone else's code or solving a problem. Helps a lot!
