I decided to make the classic game Pong today and after breaking my head over making the ball bounce correctly, I decided to look for tutorials online. There were few videos available, but none was great. Then I found couple of blog posts which were great and I followed everything in those posts to complete today's project.


If you are curious, be sure to [check my game here](http://vikaslalwani.com/projects/pong/).

Key Points

- There was not much effort from my side other than just understanding how the code explained in the blog posts worked.
