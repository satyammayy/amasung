title: Key Codes

Today I did some study by myself and hence ended up making a rather tiny project. This will continue for at least next 2-4 days as I have few things lined up that need my attention. Since I don't want to break my streak I will keep making whatever small projects I can.

Here's is today's [tiny app](http://vikaslalwani.com/projects/key-codes/). Press any key to know what is the keycode for it.

Key Points:
---
- Avoid using keypress and use keydown instead wherever possible. Keypress apparently works well only in Firefox.
- Things that look simple are probably not so simple once you start making them yourself :) This is a repeated point from couple of previous posts.
