Today's project - a live chat application! Multiple people can sign in using their name and start chatting. Itâ€™s wicked fast.

You can [try it here](http://vikaslalwani.com/projects/lets-chat/).

Looks very appealing, but it was relatively simple to build. Majority of my time was spent reading the Firebase documentation. I was thinking of making something else, but ended up making this form their tutorial. What I was trying to do was little more complex and I could not have shipped it tonight. So instead I choose this and it turned out well.


Challenges

- Since it was my first project with Firebase I had to get accustomed to their platform and docs. Other than that it was relatively straightforward.
- Some UI concerns were there which I solved, but couple of issues are still present.

This is not something that I can be proud of as most of the heavy lifting is done by Firebase. But this gave me a firm foundation nonetheless if I ever want to build something with Firebase again. And I most probably will build something very soon!
