title: Tic-Tac-Toe Game
day: 12
---

I woke up today and saw a tweet in which somebody mentioned that he made tic-tac-toe game. I tested it out and it worked pretty well. So I thought of giving it a try and so today's project is tic-tac-toe game.

You can [try it here](http://vikaslalwani.com/projects/tic-tac-toe/).

Key Points:
---
- It was a relatively tough challenge. From the outside it looks easy and maybe playing it is easy, but coding one is not. I realised it the hard way. Writing accurate logic is challenging.
- Current version works in limited cases and I need to refine the logic to make it work in all cases.
- It's a good start, but little away from complete.
- It's responsive!
