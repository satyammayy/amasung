I spent some time today fixing the logic of tit-tac-toe game that I made yesterday. Now that it works flawlessly, I am feeling proud :) It was a good challenge.

Today I made a little easier project - random quote generator. You can [try it here](http://vikaslalwani.com/projects/quote-generator/).

I like collecting great quotes and this is something I wanted to make for a long time. I am happy that it turned out good!

Key Points:
---
- There was not much of a challenge from JavaScript side so I decided to load quotes from other file to make it difficult.
- Main fight was for CSS - layout and positioning.
- Since it is responsive, I had to spend extra time to make the text legible for all screen sizes.
- Raw app was looking not so great, so I added basic CSS animation to make it better.
