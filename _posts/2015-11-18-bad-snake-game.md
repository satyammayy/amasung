title: Bad Snake Game (ugly and buggy)
day: 18
---

I failed miserably today. Plan was to make a snake game but I was not able to get anywhere close to replicate the actual game. Will start from scratch tomorrow and build an awesome version that I can be proud of.

If you are curious, see the [ugly version here](http://vikaslalwani.com/projects/bad-snake-game/). But seriously, don't do it. You have better things to do in life I believe.
