Drawing App is the name of project that I made today. It's a simple freehand drawing application based on HTML5 Canvas.

You can [play it with here](http://vikaslalwani.com/projects/drawing-app/).

It is based on HTML5 Canvas and allows you to draw lines of varying thickness and colors. You can even save the image or clear the canvas to start fresh.

I didn't know much about Canvas before today so before starting I searched for good resources and found a detailed tutorial online. That tutorial had step by step process to create a drawing application. I just followed it and added some of my flavors to create today's project. If you are interested, check out [full series on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4sioSqlXhQ).


Key Points:
---
- It was a great learning opportunity to learn about what Canvas can do.
- One thing that I don't like in the current version is the way in which the actual shapes/lines are drawn. No doubt it works, but I want to improve it to make use of a more cleaner method.
