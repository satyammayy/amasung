day: 15
---

It's a relatively straightforward project today - the famous 'This Day in History' clone. If you open the page it will tell you all the historical events that happened on this day.

You can [test is out here](http://vikaslalwani.com/projects/this-day-in-history/).

Key Points:
---
- It uses Wikipedia's API to pull the relevant data.
- Relies on JSONP because of CORS restriction imposed by Wikipedia's API.
- Minimalist layout.
