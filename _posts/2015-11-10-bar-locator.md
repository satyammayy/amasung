title: Bar Locator

Today's project is both interesting and useful - bar locator. It will track your current location (if you allow it to) and then suggest nearest bars that are open at the moment.

You can [test it out here](http://vikaslalwani.com/projects/bar-locator/).

Key Points:
---

- It uses HTML5 Geolocation API to detect user's location
- Then is pulls data for nearest 'bar' and 'night-clubs' using Google Places API.
- It will suggest one place at a time and you can cycle through the list until you find something worth trying.
